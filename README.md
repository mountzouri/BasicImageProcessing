# Basic Image Processing techniques applied to video
This video was created for the Master of Artificial Intelligence, KU Leuven. It is related to a school project of the Master Course entitled: Computer Vision.
It contains basic image processing techniques applied to an one minute video, frame by frame, using Python code and the OpenCV library. 

## Overview

The image processing operations used are the following:
* Grayscale conversion
* Gaussian filtering
* Bilateral smoothing filtering (to preserve edges)
* Thresholding operation: grab an object in RBG colour space
* Thresholding operation: grab an object in HSV colour space
* Apply binary morphological operations to improve grabbing: closing operation (dilation followed by erosion)
* Conversion of the initial video to cartoon (black and white)

## Processing
